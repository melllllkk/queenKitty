Queen Kitty vs. the Evil Pickles of Doom

Objective: Go through the obstacles to collect magical stones to save the cat clowder from evil pickles. 
To win the game, the player must collect all of the magical stones under the set time constraint. If the 
player gets tagged by an evil pickle, who are programmed to chase after the player (don't worry, they're 
kinda slow) and are also randomly placed throughout the map, the player loses. Additionally, if the player 
does not collect all of the magic stones before the timer runs out, the player also loses.

How to run the project: Run the 'app.py' file, and that's it :D

Shortcut Commands:
    'r' or 'R' --> resets the game completely
    'p' or 'P' --> pauses the game so that neither the player nor the evil pickles can move, and the timer stops
    'g' or 'G' --> automatically triggers 'Game Over'

Enjoy the Game!
